        <p>
          From a young age, Iâ€™ve been driven by the dream of creating tools that
          people everywhere could use. In 2023, I turned that dream into reality
          by founding nSquared.dev, a web development business dedicated to
          empowering small businesses with a strong online presence. Every
          project brings me closer to fulfilling that vision, one line of code
          at a time.
