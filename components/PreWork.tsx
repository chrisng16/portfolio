            <p>
              From a young age, Iâ€™ve been driven by the dream of creating tools
              that people everywhere could use. In 2023, I turned that dream
              into reality by founding nSquared.dev, a web development business
              dedicated to empowering small businesses with a strong online
              presence. Every project brings me closer to fulfilling that
              vision, one line of code at a time.
